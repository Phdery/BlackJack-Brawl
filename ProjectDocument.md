# BlackJack Brawl

## Summary

![](example-images/main-gameplay.png)

BlackJack Brawl is a fresh take on the classic card game of Blackjack, with exciting new twists. Inspired by the indie game [Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510), it adds unique mechanics to make the gameplay more fun and action-packed. Players face off against a computer opponent in rounds of Blackjack, where winning a round damages the loser’s health. The game ends when one player’s HP drops to zero.

Special cards and power-ups spice things up, letting players turn the tables and add new strategies to the game. These features make each match unique and exciting. BlackJack Brawl takes a classic game and turns it into an intense, fun-filled battle.

## Gameplay Explanation

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. Explaining the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy is encouraged.**

In BlackJack Brawl, the player plays a modified version of blackjack with augmented rules against a computer enemy. In regular blackjack, the player(s) and the dealer take turns drawing a random card from your deck (aka "hitting") and adding its value to their total. The players stop when they feel they don't need to draw more cards (aka "standing"). Whoever gets closest to a total of 21 without going over is the winner. If you go over 21, you "bust" and automatically lose. 

There are four "classes" of deck in BlackJack Brawl (2 defense and 2 offense): Club, Spades, Heart, and Diamond.

- **Club**: deals 1.5x damage to the opponent when you win
- **Spades**: when you win with a hand of 21, deal double damage to the opponent
- **Heart**: when you win, heal yourself half of the amount of damage you do
- **Diamond**: when you win with a hand of 21, heal 21 hp

Before the game begins, the player selects what suit they want their deck to be. This adds an element of strategization to the game, as the player must consider their playstyle and what type of power up they think will benefit them the most. This turns blackjack from a wholly luck based game to a part luck part skill game. The enemy is also assigned a suit.

There are also 5 special cards that are included in the player's deck, each with a special effect.

- **Uno Stop**: forcibly end the enemy's turn, worth 5 points
- **Uno +2**: add 2 points to your enemy's total, worth 2 points
- **Tarot The Fool**: increase your max score limit by 1 point, worth 0 points
- **Aggie Card**: add 5 HP to yourself, worth 5 points
- **Joker**: deal a random amount of damage between 1 and 10 to the enemy, worth 5 points

The special cards add a new dimension of gameplay not present to normal blackjack. There is a tradeoff between how useful a special card's effect is and how many points is worth. Thus, drawing a special card with a good effect may be very useful to you, but the better the effect the more points its worth, the more danger there is that you bust.

When the game starts, the player and the enemy both begin with 100 hp. Each round proceeds the same as normal blackjack, with the player and enemy taking turns drawing cards blindly from their deck and adding them to their hand. The goal is to draw until you decide to stop, and hopefully get closer to a total of 21 than your opponent. If either player exceeds a total of 21, they "bust" and automatically lose with a total of 0.

Of the basic poker cards, there are numbers 2-10; J, Q, and K (all worth 10), and A (worth either 1 or 11 depending on which benefits the player more).

After the round is over, the game compares the totals of the two players, and calculates the difference. That amount of damage is done to the losing player. Deck suit and special card effects are applied, the current hands in play move to the card graveyard, and another round begins. The game ends when one player's HP depletes to 0.

# Main Roles

- Producer + Press Kit and Web Demo: Yiming Feng
- Game Logic (Scenes) + Audio: Qingyue Yang
- Game Logic (Cards) + Gameplay Testing: Brian Li
- Game Logic (Table) + Visuals: Stephanie Hsia
- Game Logic (Player/Enemy) + Trailer: Alex Chen

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content.

_Short Description_ - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
_Procedural Terrain_ - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Producer (Yiming Feng)

**Describe the steps you took in your role as producer. Typical items include group scheduling mechanisms, links to meeting notes, descriptions of team logistics problems with their resolution, project organization tools (e.g., timelines, dependency/task tracking, Gantt charts, etc.), and repository management methodology.**

Team Scheduling and Meeting Coordination - As the producer, I organized team meetings, coordinating times that accommodated everyone’s availability. I ensured these meetings remained focused by preparing agendas and setting clear goals.

Task Division and Team Coordination - I ensured that tasks were allocated fairly and strategically among team members, considering their specific strengths and availability.

  - Contains variables for score, suit, and description of card
  - mechanism function (only used by special card classes that extend card) that takes in two Controller parameters
  - Has two signals, mouse_entered and mouse_exited
  - Card class has Area2d and CollisionShape2D
  - When mouse hovers over card, emits mouse_entered signal
  - When mouse leaves, emits mouse_exited signal
  - Two signals used later to allow for description of card to appear when hovered over
